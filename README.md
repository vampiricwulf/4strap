4strap is a [Twitter Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/index.html)-based userstyle for 4chan.org. 

Installation
======

To install it, create a blank userstyle in the [Stylish extension](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/stylish/) for Firefox and paste [4strap](https://raw.github.com/seaweedchan/4strap/master/4strap.css) in its entirety.
Alternatively, if you're a Chrome or Chromium user, you need to create a new userstyle with two sections: One on the domain "4chan.org" and the other on the domain "boards.4chan.org". Copy ONLY the contents between the @-moz-document rules in the CSS into these sections, leaving out the @-moz-document lines themselves.

Bootstrap
======

Bootstrap is a product of Twitter, Inc. and is [released](https://github.com/twitter/bootstrap/blob/master/LICENSE) under the [Apache License](http://www.apache.org/licenses/), version 2.0.

Note
======

The only supported userscript is 4chan X.

4strap is in development and will be subject to change until I release it on userstyles.org.
